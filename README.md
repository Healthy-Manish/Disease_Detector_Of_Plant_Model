# Plant Disease Classifier

## Description
In this project I have trained a model with a dataset that contain multiple images of different plant diseases and trained a Neural Network over that dataset. 
I have taken that dataset from kaggle
Link of Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset
This application is build over streamlit to create a frontend

Train the model and save it in app folder in a directory of trained_model with the name of "plant_disease_model.h5".
# Try to use GPU , I have used google collab to train this model .
