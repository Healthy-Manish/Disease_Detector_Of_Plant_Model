# Plant Disease Classifier

## Description
In this project I have trained a model with a dataset that contain multiple images of different plant diseases and trained a Neural Network over that dataset. 
I have taken that dataset from kaggle<br>
Link of Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset<br>
# This application is build over streamlit to create a frontend <br>

# Train the model and save it in app folder in a directory of trained_model with the name of "plant_disease_model.h5" 
<br>
Try to use GPU , I have used google collab to train this model

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
    ```

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**

    - **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        myenv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    - **On macOS/Linux:**

        ```bash
        source myenv/bin/activate
        ```

5. **Install the Required Packages:**
